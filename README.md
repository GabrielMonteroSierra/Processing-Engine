This project was coded in SystemVerilog.

This project was coded in SystemVerilog. The goal of this project was to read some instructions and execute them. It made use of an different memory modules (main storage and instruction storage). The code would parse the incoming instruction, read its opcode, and execute it. To do this, I had to code the execution state machine, the integer and matrix ALUs, a datamux, and a top file to connect everything together.
